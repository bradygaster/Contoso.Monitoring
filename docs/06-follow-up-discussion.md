# Discussion

Team - what do we think we want here? How about a few questions to drive a discussion:

1. Should we have questions at the end? 
1. Do we want to have questions throughout? I have carved out the steps/pages in the tutorial such that questions could be added in between each step. 
1. I'd encourage folks to walk through it and tell @bradygaster what you think it needs. How about we add an issue for each idea, each suggestion? That way we can dicuss the individual ideas/issues on GitHub. 

Thanks!
