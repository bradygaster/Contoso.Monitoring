# Question 4 (of 4)

Rate the experience of learning and using Orleans APIs 
(check all that apply)

1. I found grains somewhat confusing at first but then in practice made more sense once I used them in the app.
2. I found grains a necessary part of Orleans about which I needed to learn much more. 
3. Grains feel like a marker interface that doesnâ€™t offer much other than an abstraction
4. I found Silos a necessary part of Orleans about which I needed to learn much more about
	
On the scale of 1-7, how confident do you feel that you could build an application using Orleans?
